# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey
# About me: I am 21 and currently attending West Valley College. I work in Real Estate part-time and enjoy playing video games when I can. 
# Goals for This Course: To fully learn more and understand more about Python and use it to fully learn how to code in games or that gives me more confidence to try harder programs. 
# My First Python was print("hello, world")
